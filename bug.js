This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in JavaScript, and it can be difficult to track down because the error message is not always very specific.  Here's an example:

```javascript
const user = null;
console.log(user.name);
```

This code will throw a TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name').
